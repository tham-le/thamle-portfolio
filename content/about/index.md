I'm a software engineer based in Paris, with roots in Vietnam and a background in computational marine science. I speak English, French, and Vietnamese, and I'm passionate about building and understanding complex systems. You can find my full resume [here](/thamle_resume.pdf), see my code on [GitHub](https://github.com/tham-le), or contact me at [thamle.work@gmail.com](mailto:thamle.work@gmail.com). Outside of work, I enjoy sharpening my security skills in CTF competitions and building impactful applications at hackathons.

## My Journey: From Ocean Science to Code

My path into technology started with computational oceanography at Aix-Marseille University and LSCE-CEA, where I modeled mercury distribution in marine ecosystems using complex climate datasets. That work sparked my curiosity for building the tools themselves, leading me to software engineering.

At **42 Paris**, I dove deep into C/C++ systems programming through hands-on projects—network servers, graphics engines, and containerized services. Today, I apply that same systems-thinking approach to solve technical challenges, whether optimizing performance, securing applications, or building robust infrastructure.

## Other Interests

I participate in **CTF competitions** to learn applied security concepts hands-on, covering web security, cryptography, and binary exploitation. I maintain writeups [here](https://github.com/tham-le/CTF-Writeups). I also enjoy **hackathons** for rapid prototyping, having worked on health tech projects (DigHacktion, InnovHer) and hardware challenges (Google Hardware Hackathon).
