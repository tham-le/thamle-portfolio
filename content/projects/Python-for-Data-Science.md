# Python for Data Science

A comprehensive series of Python projects following a "piscine" learning approach, progressively building data science fundamentals through hands-on exercises.

## Modules

### Module 0: Python Basics
Core Python concepts including data structures, string manipulation, type handling, command-line arguments, custom packages, and error handling. Includes a custom progress bar implementation and Morse code encoder.

### Module 1: Arrays & Image Processing
NumPy arrays and image manipulation with matplotlib. Covers BMI calculations, 2D array operations, image loading, grayscale conversion, zooming, rotation, and color channel manipulation.

### Module 2: Data Tables
Data analysis with pandas: loading CSV files, visualizing life expectancy trends, population data, and exploring correlations between GDP and life expectancy with scatter plots.

### Module 3: Object-Oriented Programming
OOP concepts including abstract base classes, inheritance, multiple inheritance (diamond problem), class methods, dunder methods, static methods, getters/setters.

### Module 4: Data-Oriented Design
Advanced Python patterns: statistical functions (mean, median, quartile, std dev, variance), closures, decorators, and dataclasses with automatic field generation.

## Technologies

**Libraries**: NumPy, pandas, matplotlib
**Concepts**: Data structures, image processing, data visualization, OOP, functional programming, decorators

*Detailed exercises and implementations available in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/tham-le/Python-for-Data-Science).*
