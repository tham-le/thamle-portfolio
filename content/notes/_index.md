# Notes

Welcome to my digital garden ðŸŒ±

This is my **Obsidian-based knowledge base** built with [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/), containing interconnected notes on software development, cybersecurity, system design, and other technical topics I'm exploring.

## What You'll Find Here

- **"WTF is..." Series**: Deep dives into technical concepts explained clearly
- **Software Engineering**: Design patterns, architecture decisions, and best practices
- **Cybersecurity**: Security concepts, vulnerability analysis, and defensive techniques
- **System Programming**: Low-level insights and implementation details
- **Developer Tools**: Notes on productivity tools and workflows

## Navigation

These notes are **interconnected through wikilinks** - click on any highlighted link to explore related concepts. Use the graph view (if enabled) to see how topics connect.
