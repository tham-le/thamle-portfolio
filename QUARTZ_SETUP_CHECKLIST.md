### Daily Use

- [ ] Add frontmatter to new notes
- [ ] Commit and push to notes repo
- [ ] (If using GitHub Actions) Verify auto-deployment works
- [ ] (If manual) Run deploy script when ready
- [ ] Verify notes appear on site

### Troubleshooting

- [ ] Know how to check GitHub Actions logs
- [ ] Know how to run `make notes-check`
- [ ] Know how to test locally with `firebase serve`
- [ ] Have `NOTES_DEPLOYMENT.md` bookmarked
- [ ] Know how to regenerate GitHub token if expired

## üéØ Success Metrics

You're fully set up when you can:

- [ ] Write a note in Obsidian
- [ ] Push to notes repo
- [ ] See it automatically deploy (or deploy manually)
- [ ] View it live at `thamle.live/notes/`
- [ ] Wikilinks work correctly
- [ ] Search works
- [ ] Mobile experience is good
- [ ] Can repeat this workflow easily

## üõ†Ô∏è Optional Enhancements

Consider adding:

- [ ] Custom Quartz theme matching portfolio colors
- [ ] Portfolio homepage link to notes section
- [ ] Notes section link back to portfolio
- [ ] RSS feed for notes
- [ ] Analytics for notes section
- [ ] Comments system (if desired)
- [ ] Newsletter integration

## üìÖ Maintenance

Set reminders to:

- [ ] Clean up old draft notes
- [ ] Optimize images in notes
- [ ] Check for broken wikilinks

## üêõ Known Issues to Watch

- [ ] Hugo's `hugo` command clears `public/` - always deploy notes after Hugo
- [ ] Wikilinks are case-sensitive - match exact filenames
- [ ] Large images slow down site - optimize before committing
- [ ] GitHub Actions can fail silently - check logs regularly
- [ ] Firebase cache can cause stale content - hard refresh if needed
